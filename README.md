This is a Udemy course
[React Native - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/react-native-the-practical-guide/)

In 2nd branch (delete-item) I tried before watching the video to solve the problem. And it turned out to be a good alternative, since it's not the same as the instructor's.

The cancel button in "cancel button alternative" is a working alternative. But for consistency with the instructors code, I deleted it and commited also the cansel button added.
